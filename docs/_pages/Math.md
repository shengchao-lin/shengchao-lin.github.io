The equation should show up like this
\begin{equation} \label{MEE} \tag{Mass-Energy Equivalence}
    E = mc^2.
\end{equation} 
And it can be referred by \eqref{MEE}.

Equation without a tag is numbered automatically.
\begin{equation} \label{EId}
    e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0.
\end{equation}
Euler's identity is \eqref{EId}.
