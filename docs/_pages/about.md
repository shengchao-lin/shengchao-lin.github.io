I got my Ph.D. in Computational and Applied Mathematics at
[**Rice University**](https://cmor.rice.edu/).
My research lies mainly in parallel methods for PDE constrained optimization and recurrent neural networks. I was 
co-organizer of a [reading group](/reading-group/). 

I currently work at the Optimization Toolbox team for MATLAB at 
[**MathWorks**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html).
My works focus on general nonlinear optimization algorithms their deployment in safety critical areas.

During my personal time, I enjoy cooking and photography. All pictures used on this website is shot by myself (except 
for the avatar of course). You can find them in my [**gallery**](/gallery/).
